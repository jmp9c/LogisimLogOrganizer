# LogisimLogOrganizer
Organizes the log output for Logisim for CSCI 3130 at MTSU.

I originaly created a C++/Python 2.7 code to organize Log Files from Logisim, but now have created a Python program that is here to help in more than one area with CSCI 3130 and its labs.

I have currently added a binary, decimal, and hex converter.

Please download the 3130Tool.py to use. 
I will leave the original LogOrganizer tool up just because, but know that the new 3130Tool.py does include it in there as option 1. 

Feel free to create an updated version if you'd like. Definitely open source and would love input from the class.

Please email me at jmp9c@mtmail.mtsu.edu if there is any problems with the code.
